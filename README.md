# Technical-Assessment

In this directory, you will find VPG's technical assessment.

1) Review this example HTML_Javascript html code and make it visually presentable without using external framework like bootstrap

2) Review the either the .Net code snippet or the Python code snippet and fix the bugs in them.  

3) Add a function to add a temperature reading to the database. 

4) Send the new revised files back to VPG for review.

 

We expect that each candidate will review the HTML/Javascript code and either the .Net or the Python file. You are welcome to review all files if desired.
